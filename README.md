# RCredStash ![Build Status](https://github.com/adorechic/rcredstash/actions/workflows/ruby.yml/badge.svg)

RCredStash is a ruby port of [CredStash](https://github.com/fugue/credstash)


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rcredstash'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rcredstash

## Usage

```ruby
CredStash.get(key)
CredStash.get(key, context: { 'foo' => 'bar' })

CredStash.put(key, value)
CredStash.put(key, value, context: { 'foo' => 'bar' })

CredStash.list
CredStash.delete(key)
```

### CLI
rcredstash cli requires an aws credential for aws-sdk such as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

```sh
$ rcredstash help

Commands:
  rcredstash delete [key name]  # Delete a key
  rcredstash get [key name]     # Show a value for key name
  rcredstash help [COMMAND]     # Describe available commands or one specific command
  rcredstash list               # Show all stored keys
  rcredstash put [key name]     # Put a value for key name
  rcredstash setup              # Setup credstash repository on DynamoDB
```


### AWS credentials
RCredStash uses [aws-sdk v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby), so configuration options provided by aws-sdk such as `ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']` and `ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']` are available.

### Configurations

```ruby
CredStash.configure do |config|
  config.table_name = 'your_dynamodb_table_name'

  # Optional, if you want to modify them, like for Localstack.
  config.dynamo_client = Aws::DynamoDB::Client.new
  config.kms_client = Aws::KMS::Client.new
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
